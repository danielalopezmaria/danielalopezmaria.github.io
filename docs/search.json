    "text": "Childhood\nHi my name is Daniela Lopez! I was born in Colima, Mexico but left to Tijuana where I lived up until I was about 8. Almost all of my cherished memories from Mexico had been of me playing outside or even just walking to school stopping by fruit trees and eating something really fast. Ever since I was little I had a deep love for the Earth but never knew I could pursue that as a career.\n\n\n\nNow\nNow I spend my days mostly studying at the library preparing to protect nature! my friends and I love going on small adventures whether that is going on small hikes or just taking walks near the beach! I also love the occasional Victory Royale on Fortnite!"
